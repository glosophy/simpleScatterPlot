# Scatter Plot
This is a simple scatter plot I created in d3.js for my Visualization of Complex Data course. It uses the car dataset and takes three variables: x-axis values, y-axis values, and categoric variable for data point classification. It also lets you customize the colors for each data point according to the categoric variable you choose.

You can find the data set [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/glosophy/034592d78d81e29e0dcbc4f620141654/raw/a8eacd2c2ac258734dbcfbbfc96454dc958e8d4b/cars.csv).
